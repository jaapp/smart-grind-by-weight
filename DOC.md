## üîå Installation & Wiring

[<img src="media/wiring_diagram.png" alt="Wiring Diagram" width="50%">](media/wiring_diagram.png)

### Pin Configuration

**HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Connections:**
```
ESP32-S3 GPIO 2    ‚Üí    HX711 SCK
ESP32-S3 GPIO 3    ‚Üí    HX711 DOUT
ESP32-S3 3.3V      ‚Üí    HX711 VCC
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    HX711 GND
```

**Load Cell to HX711 Wiring:**
```
Load Cell           HX711
Red (E+)         ‚Üí  E+
Black (E-)       ‚Üí  E-
White (A-)       ‚Üí  A-
Green (A+)       ‚Üí  A+
Yellow (Shield)  ‚Üí  GND
```

- Connect the load cell shield wire (usually yellow) to the HX711 GND
- The HX711 only has 1 GND pin - solder the shield wire to the backside of the pin header
- **Tip**: Keep the load cell wire as short as possible to reduce noise

**Eureka Mignon Connections:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING:** Always verify your specific Eureka's wiring independently! Wire colors vary between units and cannot be trusted. Use the numbered pin positions shown in the reference image.

Using the 4-pin Eureka plug pinout (see `media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png`), counting from left to right with the plug oriented with 'ribs' towards you:

[<img src="media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png" alt="4-Pin Eureka Plug Pinout" width="50%">](media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png)

```
ESP32-S3 5V        ‚Üí    Pin 1 (5V power)
                        Pin 2 (Button signal - not used in this project)
ESP32-S3 GPIO 18   ‚Üí    Pin 3 (Motor control signal)
ESP32-S3 GND       ‚Üí    Pin 4 (Ground)
```

**4-Pin Eureka Plug Reference (Left to Right):**
- **Pin 1**: 5V power supply
- **Pin 2**: Button signal (unused in this project)  
- **Pin 3**: Motor control signal
- **Pin 4**: Ground

‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY 5V:** Use a multimeter to confirm 5V pin - wire colors vary between units! The Waveshare board has reverse polarity protection, and button/motor wires can be swapped without risk of damage.

### Installation Steps

1. **Flash the firmware** on the Waveshare board (see Build Instructions below)
2. **Add the 1000ŒºF capacitor** between 5V and ground (protects against brownouts)
3. **Create HX711 to Waveshare connection:**
   - Add angled pin headers to HX711 (VCC, GND, DOUT, SCK pins)
   - Connect dupont cables to Waveshare board
   - Load cell can be directly soldered to HX711
4. **For Eureka Mignon assembly:**
   - Disassemble top plate and front plate
   - Remove the button and store it (not needed)
   - Use JST-PH plug to connect to Waveshare board
   - **WARNING:** Wire colors vary significantly between Eureka units - always verify pin functions with a multimeter before connecting!
   - Mount Waveshare screen using 3D printed adapter where original screen was (the Waveshare screen with adapter replaces the original screen and reuses the original mounting screws)
   - Fish HX711 wire through housing, exit via button hole
   - Mount load cell and HX711 to 3D printed back plate
   - Clip 3D printed back plate onto Eureka Mignon
   - Connect plug to HX711
   - Add 3D printed cover plate and screw down
   - Add 3D printed dosing cup holder on load cell and screw down
   - Hide screws with 3D printed screw covers

### Grinding Profiles
All profiles are fully customizable. Default grind-by-weight targets (fallback time values shown in parenthesis):
- **Single**: 9‚ÄØg (5‚ÄØs)
- **Double**: 18‚ÄØg (10‚ÄØs)  
- **Custom**: 21.5‚ÄØg (12‚ÄØs)

> üí° **Tip** ‚Äì the target label always shows the active unit (`g` or `s`). Long-press to edit in whichever mode you are currently using.

### Navigation
- **Swipe left/right** to navigate between menu tabs
- **Swipe up/down** on the ready screen to toggle between grind-by-weight and grind-by-time modes (when enabled in Settings ‚Üí Grind Mode)
- **Tap** to select profiles or buttons
- **Long press** on profile targets to edit/customize them

> **Color cues:** The GRIND button background turns **red** in weight mode and **blue** in time mode, so you always know which behaviour is armed.

### Grind Mode Settings
Access **Settings ‚Üí Grind Mode** to configure:
- **Swipe Gestures**: Enable/disable vertical swipe gestures for mode switching (default: disabled)
- **Time Mode**: Directly toggle between Weight and Time modes regardless of swipe setting

### Basic Operation
These steps describe the default grind-by-weight workflow:
1. Select profile by tapping on the main screen
2. Long press the profile target to edit/customize the weight if needed
3. Place the dosing cup on the scale platform
4. Press the GRIND button ‚Äì the scale will tare automatically
5. The system grinds to the precise target weight using the predictive algorithm
6. GRIND COMPLETE shows the final settled weight in grams (with statistics)

Need the stock timed run? Enable swipe gestures in **Settings ‚Üí Grind Mode**, then swipe up or down on the ready screen before you start; the GRIND button background turns blue to confirm time mode is active (red = weight). Alternatively, use the direct **Time Mode** toggle in settings.

> **Time mode pulse button:** In time mode completion, a "+" button appears next to OK for 100ms additional grinding pulses.

### Display Modes
- **Arc Layout**: Clean, minimal arc-based interface

## üß† Algorithm Details

### Why This Algorithm Works

- **Zero-shot learning algorithm**: Needs no prior knowledge or manually tuned variables. Instantly adapts to changes in temperature, humidity, grinding coarseness, bean type, etc.
- **Two-tier approach**: Grinding is noisy (mechanical, electrical) so we use a sophisticated approach:
  - **Predictive Phase**: Grind as fast as possible using predictive algorithm to barely UNDERSHOOT target weight (overshoot is unrecoverable)
  - **Learning Phase**: Learns flow rate and grind latency (bean to cup time) to predict when to stop motor (coast time)
  - **Pulse Phase**: Uses worst-case (95th percentile) flow rate for conservative pulsing until target ¬± tolerance is reached

### Key Algorithm Steps

1. **Determine grind latency** from first detectable flow over 500ms confirmation window
2. **Compute motor stop target weight** from latency √ó flow √ó coast ratio (USER_LATENCY_TO_COAST_RATIO)
3. **Stop at target - motor_stop_target_weight**, then apply bounded pulses based on 95th percentile flow rate
4. **Conservative approach**: Err on undershooting to prevent overshoot, repeat until target ¬± tolerance reached

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this modification work on grinders other than the Eureka Mignon Specialita?**

See the comprehensive **[Grinder Compatibility Matrix](GRINDER_COMPATIBILITY.md)** for detailed compatibility information across different grinder models, including confirmed compatible models, adaptation requirements, and installation methods.

**Can I use this to grind directly into a portafilter instead of a dosing cup?**

Yes, but requires modifications: use 1kg load cell (vs 0.3kg) for better accuracy with heavier portafilters. Design and 3D print custom portafilter holder mounting to load cell. The dosing cup holder design serves as reference for portafilter adapter.
